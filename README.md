#Exo-Planet finding model to explore the new world
I Collaborated with Government Polytechnic College students to develop an ML model capable of
classifying exoplanet candidates as Confirmed or False Positive using NASA’s Cumulative Kepler Dataset.We did this project to compete in the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 at SNS College of
Technology, our project was highly appreciated by the judges, earning us top rewards and progression
to the next round.I Handled the end-to-end model development, including data preprocessing, feature normalization,
and model training using the Random Forest Classifier.Performed feature selection to identify key astrophysical parameters influencing exoplanet
confirmation and fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve optimal accuracy.Achieved 91% model accuracy and 98% validation accuracy on NASA’s candidate dataset, correctly
predicting exoplanet confirmations.
